# Tree-Inference

This repository contains the data and source code (Python code in a Jupyter Notebook) used to analyze 24 single-cellâ€“derived bulk whole-exome sequenced sublines. The notebook includes mutation data preprocessing, phylogenetic tree inference, C19-doublet analysis, and precise locations of 23 mutations potentially affected by loss of heterozygosity (LOH) events in sublines C2 and C5.

For complete details, please refer to the Jupyter Notebook [Tree_Inference_Code.ipynb](https://github.com/smalikic/Tree-Inference/blob/main/Tree_Inference_Code.ipynb), located in the root directory of this repository.

> **Note:** Before running the notebook, ensure that all files inside the `input/vcf_files` directory are uncompressed (i.e., unzip all `.zip` archives).
