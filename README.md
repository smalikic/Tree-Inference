# Tree Inference on 24 Single-Cell–Derived Melanoma Sublines

This repository contains the data and source code (Python code in a Jupyter Notebook) used to analyze 24 single-cell–derived bulk whole-exome sequenced sublines. The notebook includes mutation data preprocessing, phylogenetic tree inference, C19-doublet analysis, and precise locations of 23 mutations potentially affected by loss of heterozygosity (LOH) events in sublines C2 and C5.

For complete details (including documentation), please refer to the Jupyter Notebook [Tree_Inference_Code.ipynb](https://github.com/smalikic/Tree-Inference/blob/main/Tree_Inference_Code.ipynb), located in the root directory of this repository.


> **Note 1:** Before running the notebook, ensure that all files inside the `input/vcf_files` directory are uncompressed (i.e., unzip all `.zip` archives).

> **Note 2:** Please note that the total size of this repository currently exceeds 3 GB. After completing the decompression steps described above, you will need at least 12 GB of available local storage to accommodate the full contents of the repository.
